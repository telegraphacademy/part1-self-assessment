##Telegraph prep part 1 self-assessment
**This is solo work do not ask others for help**

###String: 'Javascript is super duper awesome'
###Object: myProfileObject = {};
###Array: javaScriptArray = ['J', 'a', 'v', 'a'];

####1. Print to the Javascript console the 5th letter in a string (no variables allowed).

####2. Loop through a string and print each character to the Javascript console (the only variable allowed is the iterator).

####3. Copy and refactor problem 2 using a `while` loop.

####4. Add the following key value pairs to the `myProfileObject` object: 
  1. 'school' set to 'Telegraph Prep'
  2. 'location' set to 'Berkeley, California'
  3. 'name' set to your name

  **NOTE: Explain the method you are using to do this (hint: '_____ notation')**

####5. Create a function that takes an object and a name as parameters. It should return the object with ONLY these properties:
  1. Your first and last name: **`name`: `'Bobby Tables'`**
  2. Your **`place of birth`: city, state (or equivalent), country**
  3. Your **`hobby` or favorite activity**
  4. A method that prints: 'My first name is [first name] and my last name is [last name]' 

**NOTE: Test your function. 
  (1) Print what your function returns in the console. 
  (2) Invoke the method and check that it logs the intended phrase.

####6. Create a function that takes a name as an parameter and returns `true` if it is equivalent to the `name` property returned from the function call above.

####7. Create a function that takes an object as a parameter and returns the `length` of the object.

####8. Create a function that modifies the `javaScriptArray` to be `['J', 'a', 'v', 'a', 'S', 'c', 'r', 'i', 'p', 't']`

####9. Create a function that takes in the `javaScriptArray` array and returns a NEW array with value `['JavaScript']`


**Must include:**
- pseudocode
- proper indentation '2 spaces' not tabs
- Remove unnecessary `console.log` statements

##Algorithm Design
1. Define the rules of the problem
2. Determine any constraints
3. Explore the problem and discover techniques or patterns that might be useful
4. Generate a simple plan that solves the problem
5. Turn that plan into steps- put your pseudocode skills to use!
